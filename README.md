3. Add the following to your `server.cfg`:

```bash
ensure lxr-core
ensure lxr-safecracker
```

## Configuration

The safe cracking configuration can be customized in the `config.lua` file. Below is a summary of the main options:

### Basic Configuration

```lua
Config = Config or {}

Config.Difficulty = {
    Easy = 1,
    Medium = 2,
    Hard = 3,
}

Config.CrackerTypes = {
    "Standard", -- Basic lock cracking
    "Advanced", -- Advanced lock cracking with additional steps
}

Config.MinigameDuration = {
    Easy = 30, -- 30 seconds for easy locks
    Medium = 60, -- 60 seconds for medium locks
    Hard = 90 -- 90 seconds for hard locks
}

Config.Rewards = {
    Easy = {cash = 100, items = {"GoldBar"}},
    Medium = {cash = 500, items = {"Diamond"}},
    Hard = {cash = 1000, items = {"Emerald"}}
}
```

### Example Setup

Hereâ€™s an example setup where the cracking difficulty is set to medium, with a 60-second timer and a reward system of $500 cash and a diamond:

```lua
Config = {
    Difficulty = "Medium",
    CrackerTypes = {"Advanced"},
    MinigameDuration = {
        Easy = 30,
        Medium = 60,
        Hard = 90
    },
